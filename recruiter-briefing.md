# Recruiter Briefing & Career Narrative: Alex Riley

## Professional Synopsis for Talent Professionals
I am a senior-level international trade strategist with a 15+ year track record of building and scaling global business operations. My core value lies in the intersection of high-level strategy (INSEAD MBA) and hands-on operational execution. I am not a theoretical consultant; I am a builder and a problem-solver who has managed P&Ls, led cross-functional teams, and personally negotiated multimillion-dollar deals on the ground in the UAE, EU, and Asia.

## Leadership & Management Philosophy
My leadership style is built on three pillars:
1.  **Empowerment through Clarity:** I provide my teams with a clear strategic vision and the data they need to make informed decisions. I empower them to take ownership, and I hold them accountable for results.
2.  **Data-Driven Decisions:** Gut instinct is valuable, but it must be validated by data. I foster a culture where we analyze metrics, from supply chain costs to sales conversion rates, to drive continuous improvement.
3.  **Lead from the Front:** I am not a manager who stays in the office. I am in the trenches with my team, whether that's joining a high-stakes negotiation, troubleshooting a logistics issue, or meeting with key clients.

## Key Career Transitions & Motivations
*   **Move to Export Management (Global AgriCorp):** After building a strong foundation in logistics, I wanted to move closer to the commercial core of the business. This role gave me direct P&L responsibility and allowed me to own the entire export lifecycle, from sales strategy to final delivery.
*   **Launch of Freelance Consultancy (Riley Trade Solutions):** After years in a large corporate structure, I saw a critical gap in the market: SMBs desperately needed senior-level trade expertise but couldn't afford a full-time executive. My consultancy was a strategic move to apply my skills in a more agile, high-impact environment, allowing me to serve as a fractional Chief Trade Officer to multiple ambitious companies simultaneously.

## Signature Accomplishments (STAR Format)

### 1. EU Market Entry for Pakistani Textile Firm
*   **Situation:** A successful Pakistani textile firm was saturated in its regional market and needed to find a new growth engine. The EU represented a massive opportunity but was blocked by complex regulations and a lack of distribution channels.
*   **Task:** As their lead consultant, I was tasked with creating and executing an end-to-end market entry strategy.
*   **Action:** I developed a multi-phase plan: identified Germany as the beachhead, created a compliance roadmap for REACH/OEKO-TEX standards, engineered an optimized logistics chain via the Port of Hamburg, and personally vetted and negotiated the contract with a German 3PL and distribution partner.
*   **Result:** This created a new, sustainable revenue stream of **$2.2M in the first year**, increasing the company's total export volume by 40% and establishing a strong foothold in the European market.

### 2. $5M UAE Trade Finance De-Risking
*   **Situation:** A client had a massive $5M sales opportunity with a new buyer in Dubai but was exposed to significant non-payment risk.
*   **Task:** My role was to structure a 100% secure trade finance mechanism to protect my client's revenue.
*   **Action:** I designed and negotiated a Confirmed Irrevocable Letter of Credit at Sight. I trained the client's team on the stringent UCP 600 documentation standards and managed the execution for all 10 shipments, ensuring perfect compliance.
*   **Result:** The client received **100% of their payment within 3-5 days** of each shipment, eliminating all risk and dramatically improving their cash flow. This single transaction cemented a multi-year, high-volume relationship with the UAE buyer.

## Ideal Next Role & Aspirations
I am driven by opportunities to build and scale. I am open to senior leadership roles (Director, VP, Head of International) within a dynamic, growth-oriented company where I can take full ownership of a P&L, build a high-performing team, and drive global expansion strategy.
