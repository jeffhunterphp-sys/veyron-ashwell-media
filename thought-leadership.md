# Perspectives on Trade, Strategy & Career Growth

### What's the biggest mistake companies make when first exporting?
They fall in love with a market without truly understanding its costs and complexities. They get excited about the potential revenue but fail to calculate the "landed cost"—the full cost of getting that product from their factory into the customer's hands. This includes shipping, insurance, tariffs, customs brokerage fees, and local taxes. Without this number, your pricing is a guess, and your profit margin is a fantasy.

### What book has most influenced your professional philosophy?
"Thinking, Fast and Slow" by Daniel Kahneman. It's not a business book, but it's the best book *for* business. It explains the two systems of thinking: the fast, intuitive "System 1" and the slow, analytical "System 2." In international trade, you're constantly battling the biases of System 1. It teaches you to slow down, question your assumptions, and use data (System 2) to make high-stakes decisions, which is the essence of my "Profit & Protect" framework.

### How do you view the impact of AI on the logistics industry?
AI's biggest immediate impact will be in predictive logistics. Today, we track shipments. Tomorrow, AI will predict disruptions before they happen. It will analyze weather patterns, port congestion, labor actions, and geopolitical tensions to re-route shipments proactively. For businesses, this means moving from a reactive "Where is my container?" model to a proactive "What is the safest and most efficient path for my container?" model. This is a game-changer for supply chain resilience.

### What is your single most important piece of advice for a high-stakes negotiation?
Know your "walk-away" point before you even sit down at the table, and be genuinely willing to walk away. Your greatest source of power in a negotiation is not your cleverness; it's your preparation and your ability to be content with a "no deal" outcome. If you are desperate, your counterpart will sense it and exploit it. Do the financial modeling beforehand, define your absolute bottom line, and negotiate with confidence above that line.

### What advice would you give to someone starting a career in international trade?
Become a specialist in the "boring" stuff: documentation and trade finance. Anyone can talk about sales strategy, but very few people truly understand the mechanics of a Letter of Credit or the specific documents required to clear customs in Dubai. This technical knowledge is your foundation. It makes you incredibly valuable to any team and gives you the credibility to eventually lead the high-level strategy. Master the plumbing before you try to design the building.
