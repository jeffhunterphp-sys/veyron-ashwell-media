# Case Study: De-risking a $5M Rice Export Deal to the UAE

## Client Profile
**Company:** A mid-sized agricultural exporter based in Southeast Asia.
**Product:** Premium Basmati rice.
**Challenge:** The client had a significant opportunity to secure a $5 million contract with a new, large buyer in Dubai. However, they were hesitant due to the size of the deal and their unfamiliarity with the buyer. They needed a secure trade finance structure that would eliminate the risk of non-payment.

## Project Objective
To structure a complex, multi-shipment trade finance deal using a Letter of Credit (LC) that would provide maximum payment security for the exporter while being acceptable to the UAE-based buyer.

## Veyron Ashwell's Role: Trade Finance & Risk Mitigation Specialist

### Phase 1: Structuring the Deal (1 Month)
1.  **Risk Assessment:** Conducted due diligence on the Dubai-based buyer and analyzed the potential risks, including payment default, shipping delays, and quality disputes.
2.  **Instrument Selection:** Recommended a **"Confirmed Irrevocable Letter of Credit at Sight,"** payable at a top-tier international bank. The "confirmation" added a second layer of payment guarantee from another bank, virtually eliminating the risk of default.
3.  **Term Negotiation:** Acted as the intermediary between the exporter, the buyer, and their respective banks. Negotiated the specific terms of the LC to ensure they were compliant with **UCP 600** (the international rules for LCs) and operationally feasible for the client. This included defining precise document requirements, shipment schedules, and inspection protocols.

### Phase 2: Execution & Documentation Management (Ongoing)
1.  **Documentary Credit Training:** Provided the client's export team with hands-on training on how to prepare a perfect set of documents (Bill of Lading, Commercial Invoice, Certificate of Origin, Inspection Certificate) to present under the LC. Discrepancies in documents are the #1 reason for payment delays.
2.  **Shipment Coordination:** Oversaw the coordination for each of the ten scheduled shipments, ensuring that logistics events aligned perfectly with the LC's strict deadlines.
3.  **Presentation & Payment:** Managed the final presentation of documents to the confirming bank after each shipment. Ensured all documents were 100% compliant, resulting in the client receiving payment within 3-5 business days of presentation, as per the "at sight" terms.

## Quantifiable Results
*   **Risk Elimination:** Secured **100% of the $5M revenue** for the client, completely eliminating the risk of non-payment.
*   **Cash Flow Improvement:** The "at sight" payment structure meant the client's cash was not tied up for 60-90 days, significantly improving their working capital cycle.
*   **New Market Relationship:** The secure and professionally managed transaction built immense trust, cementing a long-term, high-volume relationship between the exporter and the UAE buyer.
*   **Internal Capability:** The client's export team gained invaluable expertise in managing complex LC transactions, a skill they have since applied to other large deals.

**Conclusion:** This project demonstrates the critical importance of expertly structured trade finance. By implementing a robust Letter of Credit, we converted a high-risk opportunity into a secure, profitable, and lasting international partnership.
